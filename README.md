# Data Engineering Projects:

## AWS Projects:

## GCP Projects

### [Gasoline in Brazil | Pipeline Google Cloud Platform Project](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/pipeline_gcp)
  * In this project covers all stages of a real Data Engineer project. I was able to solve the problem of how to use data to answer important questions to allow a company to know about:
  * Repository: https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/pipeline_gcp

## Other Data engineering projects:

### [Modern Data Stack -- MongoDB --> Airbyte --> Snowflake --> DBT](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/modern_data_stack_pipeline/tree/development)
  * The Modern Data Stack Pipeline project showcases the seamless orchestration of data through a cutting-edge architecture designed for efficiency, scalability, and flexibility. This project leverages key components such as MongoDB, Airbyte, Snowflake, and DBT to create a robust data infrastructure that empowers organizations to harness the power of their data.
  * https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/modern_data_stack_pipeline/tree/development
### [Modern Data Stack | Airbyte + DBT + Snoflake + Airflow](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/modern-data-stack)
  * This time the objective was to develop the entire Data Pipeline using some tools that together are known as "Modern Data Stack". Initially, a Covid 19 data connector was created with Airbyte. The saved data was integrated and sent to our Data Warehouse (Snowflake). To build the final table, I used DBT, allowing transformations and versioning of SQL codes, which is an extremely powerful tool. Finally, to orchestrate this entire pipeline, I used Airflow.
  * Repository: https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/modern-data-stack

### [Human Resources Analytics | Data Engineering & Data Science Project](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/human-resource-analytics)
  * In this project covering all stages of a real Data Science project I was able to solve the problem of how to use data to answer important questions to allow a company to know about:
  * What are the factors that influence an employee to leave the company?
  * How to retain people?
  * How to anticipate and know if a particular employee will leave the company?
  * Finally, make resources available so that the company can predict to verify whether or not an employee will leave the company based on attributes such as behavior and workload, level of satisfaction with the company and performance results.
  * Repository: https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/human-resource-analytics

### [Star Jeans - (Data Engineering) ETL Project](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/H-M_Jeans)
  * This project aims to solve the following business problem: Eduardo and Marcelo are two Brazilians, friends and business partners. After several successful businesses, they are planning to enter the fashion market. US as an E-commerce business model. The initial idea is to enter the market with just one product and for a specific audience, in this case, the product would be Jeans for the male audience. The objective is to maintain the operating cost low and scale as they get customers.
  * So this project went through the entire data pipeline, from the extraction to the architecture of airflow automation.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Airbnb - Athens | Grecce - Listing Price Estimator](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/airbnb)
  * This project's main objective is to analyze Airbnb data for the city of Athens and build a machine-learning model to predict the price of new listings. As a prediction algorithm, the LGBM was used, obtaining a MAPE of 30%.
  * Repository: https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/airbnb

### [Rossmann Store - Forecasting Sales](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/RossmannStore)
  * Currently, knowing how much your company will bill in the coming weeks would change your decisions.

In this project, I built a Machine Learning classifier to label fraudulent transactions with 99.7% accuracy.
The performance of this model would bring revenue of U$898 million according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.
  * Repository: https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/fraud_detection
  
### [House Prices - Regression Problem](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/house_prices)
  * Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest to both buyers and sellers. In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that can accurately estimate the price of the house given the features
  The Random Forest Regressor algorithm was used, obtaining a MAPE of 7%.

### [Health Insurance Predict](https://github.com/jorgebarrosmedeiros/health_insurance)
  * This project aims to make the company "Insurance Health" profit more. This company provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: auto insurance. Therefore, a machine learning model was built that detects customers interested in the services. The ExtraTreesClassifier model was used, which obtained the best performance from the cumulative gain curve and lift curve metrics, to solve the problem.
